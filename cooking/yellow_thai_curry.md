## Yellow Curry

Heat coconut oil on medium heat in saucepan until shimmery.

SautÃ© sliced onions until they are translucent and fragrant.

Add sliced chicken and cook for about 5 minutes. The chicken should look just
cooked on about half the surface.

Add potatoes and curry paste. Throughly coat the chicken and potatoes in the
paste. Cook for another 2-5 minutes.
> This is also the time to add in harder vegetables like carrots.


Add cocounut cream, water, and additional add-ons to the pan. Reduce heat to
low and bring to just below a simmer.
> If there are bubbles your heat is too high. Cooking like this for too long
> will cook the potatoes to the point where the starches leak into the curry
> and you are left with a grainy curry instead of a smooth luscious curry.


Cook for roughly 20-30 minutes. The chicken should be cooked all the way
through and potatoes should be soft enough to bite through without being mushy.
> Now is a great time to start thinking about cooking the rice!


Turn heat off. Add coconut sugar and fish sauce; mix until incorporated.

## Jasmine Rice

In a small pot, melt butter and salt together over medium heat.
> The butter and salt will hiss and bubble. This should be about 30-60 seconds,
> about the time it takes me to grab my rice container.


Add rice and mix until all the rice has been coated in butter.

Continue cooking until rice is fragrant and nutty. Roughly 3 minutes.
> You mainly just don't want to burn the rice here, just give it some
> additional flavors through the butter.


Add in boiling water and immediately cover. Turn heat down to low to keep a
simmer inside.
> If adding non-boiling water, make sure to bring the rice up to a simmer
> before covering.


Simmer for 20 minutes then cut the heat and fluff with a fork.

Plate and serve with curry.
