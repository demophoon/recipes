### Cream of Mushroom Soup
> Holy moly, this is amazing and will ruin you to any of that canned stuff.

| Ingredient | Quantity | Notes |

| Mushrooms | 1 Pound finely diced | I use oysters but buy something you enjoy eating. It's basically the whole dish so don't skimp out |
| Butter | 3 Tbsp | |
| Kosher Salt | 1-2 Large Pinches | |
| Garlic | 2-4 Cloves | Minced |
| Flour | 1-2 Tbsp | |
| Bourbon | 1oz | |

## Cream of Mushroom Soup
> I've used this as a base to make an unbelievably rich mushroom gravy.

SautÃ© the mushrooms with salt and butter over medium heat until mushrooms give
up some liquid. About 5-8 minutes.
> It's very hard to overcook mushrooms so don't be afraid of cooking too long.

Add minced garlic to pan and cook for 30 seconds.
> Don't overcook the garlic! Otherwise you will get a burned taste.

Add the flour to the pan and let it absorb all of the butter. Cook for about 30
seconds.
> The flour should look like its coating most of the mushrooms.

Pour in bourbon to deglaze the pan. Make sure to get all the browned bits off
the bottom of the pan. About 15-30 seconds.

Pour in all of the chicken broth and heavy cream. Bring to a medium simmer.

Once at a medium simmer add soy sauce and let it reduce by about half. About
20-30 minutes.
> You may need to eyeball this if it doesn't reduce as much as you'd expect.

## Casserole

Blanch the green beans in salted water.

Preheat oven to 350F.

Toss about half of the green beans with half of the fried onions and half of
the cream of mushroom soup.

Pour out mixture into a casserole dish. Pour the rest of the cream of mushroom
soup over top. Cover the rest of the mixture with fried onions.

Cover and cook for 15-20 minutes in the oven.

Uncover and cook for an additional 5-10 minutes.
